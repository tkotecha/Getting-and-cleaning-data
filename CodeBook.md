This is the codebook for the tidy data that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations needed to tidy the data

Identifiers:
1. Activity: the type of activity conducted by the subject when measurements were conducted
- LAYING
- SITTING
- STANDING
- WALKING
- WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
- WALKING UPSTAIRS
2. Subject: the person conducting the activity , ranging from 1-30

In terms of assigning all the data frames the following was done:

features: features.txt
activities: activity_labels.txt
subject_test: sebject_test.txt
x_test: x_test.txt
y_test: y_test.txt
subject_train: subject_train.txt
x_train: x_train.txt
y_train: y_train.txt


Measurements of activity were given the following labels:
